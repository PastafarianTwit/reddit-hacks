# reddit hacks

This is a compendium of rough code to demonstrate how to interact with new
reddit API features.

## Libraries

The `redditclient` module provides a basic API client. Currently it only
supports signing in and the upcoming "flair" feature.

## Tools

The `flairsync` script provides a simple way to maintain a subreddit's flair
using a local CSV file.
